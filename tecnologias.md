The following technologies were used for the creation and desing of
the project:

Hand-drawn sketches and prototypes to simulate the system interfaces.
Visual programming concepts: in this case, we used wxGlade.
Basic UI/UX desing, text boxes, and graphic elements.
Navigation logic, representing how the screens connect and how
subtotals and totals are processed.
