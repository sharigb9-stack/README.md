The proyect involves designing a digital system for selling movie tickets, intended to facilitate ticket purchases, 
the selection of concessions, and the generation of a final purchase summary.

The main objective is to simulate the operation of a real system like those
used in modern cinema box offices or mobile applications.

They system consist of several windows that guide the user step by
step from login to purchase confirmation.

This project allows for an understanding of how a graphical
interface is structured, how information is distributed across
each screen, and how each screen connects to guide the user
throughout the entire process.
